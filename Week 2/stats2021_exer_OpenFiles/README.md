### RStudio part

* In RStudio open the R markdown file (.Rmd) by clicking on it in the Files pane.
* Complete the steps outlined in the assignment. (See the assignment answer sheet file included in this repository.)
* Create a markdown (.md) document by clicking the Knit button. Make sure the markdown file gets saved in the same folder as the R markdown file so it will get pushed back to your GitHub repository.

### Jamovi part

* Open Jamovi
* Try opening each of the file types (.csv, .sav, .xlsx) in Jamovi.

## Push your updated files to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in RStudio.
  * Here's a nice video a student found demonstrating this process. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL6L2MNqPHg&feature=youtu.be 
  * Be patient as you complete these steps. RStudio can be a bit slow to respond.
  * Click on the Git tab in the top right section of the window.
  * You should see the files in your repository in the window.
  * Click in the checkbox in the Staged column to stage the changes you made.
  * Click on the Commit button. (Just above the Staged, Status, Path labels at the top of the pane.)
  * A new window will open which is titled RStudio: Review Changes.
  * Enter a commit message in the field on the right side of the window and click Commit.
  * Another popup should come up while the commit it made. You can close it when it's done.
  * Click the Push button on the top right of the window.
  * Another popup should come up while the push is done. You can close it when it's done.
  * If you check your GitHub repository, your new files or changes should be there.
* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
* You can also directly add files to your GitHub repository online.
  * Navigate to your GitHub repository in a browser.
  * Click on the Add File button and select Upload Files. (It's right next to the Code button where you copy the URL for the repository when you clone it.)
  * Drag the files to the window or browse for them.
  * Remember to scroll to the bottom of the window and commit your changes or your file(s) won't be saved.
* Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
